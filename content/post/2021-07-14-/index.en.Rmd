For this project, we'll use the following libraries:
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(quanteda)
library(stringr)
```

Quanteda provides a well-equipped, far-reaching alternative to Gensim's *Phrases* suite. Where the latter requires a 'bottoms-up' approach with repeated calls to the `Phrases()` function, the former supplies a more holistic and inclusive methodology with just one pass through the corpus, even arming the user with a collection of tokenizers and dfm functionalities.

To begin working with quanteda, we start by creating our example corpus: a short assembly of some IRS instructions. Again, "instructions.rda" refers to a vector of strings, where each string encompasses the text belonging to an entire article.
```{r}
# load IRS instruction vector
textpath <- "/home/alex/Projects/taxembed/data/corpora/irs_corpi/instructions.rda"
load(textpath)

# create an example corpus from the first several instruction texts
excor <- paste(instext[1], instext[2], instext[3], instext[4], instext[5], instext[6])

# clean the text
excor <- str_replace_all(excor, pattern = "(\\n|\\t)+", replacement = " ")
excor <- str_replace_all(excor, pattern = "\\s{2,}", replacement = " ")
```

Now, we can split the example corpus into tokens with quanteda's `tokens()` function. We can remove punctuation, symbols, numbers, urls, separators, and hyphens by setting their corresponding flags, but for this example, we'll leave the text intact.
```{r}
# tokenize the corpus
extoks <- tokens(excor)
```

```{r}
# list first few tokens
toksngram <- tokens_ngrams(extoks, n = 2)
head(toksngram, 50)
```
Note: some of these overlap, which can cause confusion

Quanteda allows the simultaneous use of n-grams with different dimensions. That is, the `tokens_ngrams()` includes the **n** parameter (an integer vector) that allows the function to identify a range of **n**-grams in the same pass. For example, it can identify bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams without exclusion or the need to cycle text back through the parser.
```{r}
# remember, tokens_ngrams takes a tokens object
tokens_ngrams(tokens(c("a b c d e", "c d e f g")), n = 2:4)
```

In addition to varying n-grams, Quanteda also allows concurrent processing with the `quanteda_options()` settings. Usually, `RcppParallel::defaultNumThreads()` defines the default number of threads for parallelized functions, but we can manually adjust that parameter too. Note: we can change this once per session
```{r, results = "hold"}
# adjust the number of threads
quanteda_options(threads = 8)

# show the current number
quanteda_options("threads")
```
