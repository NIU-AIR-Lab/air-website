<p>Similarities and analogies offer insightful measures for evaluating embedding performance, but Tensorboard, a project offshoot of Tensorflow, provides a completely different set of tools for analyzing vector representations in relatively few dimensions: PCA visualization. The <a href="https://projector.tensorflow.org/">webpage</a> requires two initial documents to properly animate the embedding: a tab-delimited TSV file of word tensors, and another tab-delimited TSV file of their respective metadata.<br />
Together, this information builds a three-dimensional plot that allows the user to search for terms, find nearest neighbors (by cosine or euclidean distance), and restructure the data in the form of UMAP or T-SNE charts.</p>
